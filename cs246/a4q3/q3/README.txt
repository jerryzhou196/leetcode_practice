The files in this directory should build into an executable that only
displays a blank canvas.

To do:
* Create a Makefile for your program.  This is a requirement.  Do it first.  It
  should build an executable called a4q3.
*  
* Make the necessary changes to the test harness, such that the *box commands
  create and attach the necessary decorators.  Nothing currently in the
  test harness needs to be removed or altered; you should only need to add
  code to it.
