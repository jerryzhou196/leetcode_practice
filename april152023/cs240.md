Instead, we are trying to prove any binary tree with n nodes has height at least:

$log_2(n+1) - 1 \in \Theta(log_2(n))$

We attempt to prove this fact:

If we fix h, the # of nodes n is at most $1 + 2 + 4 ... + 2^h$ such that:

Therefore, we can state that:

$n <= 2^{h+1} - 1$ which implies that $n + 1 <= 2^{h+1}$ so therefore $log_2(n+1) - 1 <= h$

> Riducously stupid fucking name for a binary heap with STRUCTUAL PROPERTY and HEAP-ORDER property

Proof for the following claim:

If we fix h, the # of nodes n is *at least* $2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^(h - 1) = 2^h$

$2^h <= n -> h <= log_2(n)$

Proof for the following claim: 

Claim: for a heap with n nodes, height h
$h \in \Theta(log_2(n))$

Heaps in Array for Navigations:

- Let H be the heap of n items

- Let A be the array of size n

- Store root in A[0] and continue with elements level-by-level from spot

Lower bound Î©(log_2(n)):

For a heap (which is a complete binary tree), the number of nodes n is at least $2^h$. This is because each level of the heap can have at most twice as many nodes as the previous level, and so if you add up all the nodes, the number of nodes is at least $2^h$.

Taking the base-2 logarithm of both sides, we get $h <= log_2(n)$. This means that the height of the heap is at least log_2(n), so $h \in Î©(log_2(n))$.

Upper bound O(log_2(n)):
Similarly, the number of nodes n is at most $2^{h+1} - 1$ for a complete binary tree with height h. This is because a heap is a complete binary tree and in a complete binary tree with height h, there are at most $2^{h+1} - 1$ nodes.

So, if we rearrange that for h, we get $h >= log_2(n+1) - 1$.

As n goes to infinity, the +1 inside the logarithm and the -1 outside the logarithm become negligible, and we can say that h is bounded above by log_2(n). Therefore, $h \in O(log_2(n))$

**Fix-Down (deleteMax?) in Heap**

```python
def fixdown(A,i,n):
    # A: an array that 
    # stores a heap of size n
    # i: an index corresponding 
    # to a node of the heap
    while i is not a leaf:
        j <- left child of i # Find the child with the larger key
        if (i has right child and A[right cild of i].key > A[j].key)
            j <- right child of i
        if A[i].key >= A[j].key reak
        swap A[j] and A[i]
        i <- j
```

## Priority Queue Realization Using Heaps ðŸ˜±

```python
def insert(x):
    # increase size
    l = last()
    A[l] = x
    fixup(A,l)
```

```python
def deleteMax():
    l = last()
    # swap A[root()], A[l]
```

# Sorting Using Heaps

We introducted an *abstract* sorting algorithim of a priority queue

`O(init + n * insert + n * deleteMax)`

Using the binary heaps implementation of PQ:

```python
def sortingWithFuckingPQandHeap(heapArr):
    h = Heap() 
    for x in range(0,len(heapArr)):
        H.insert(heapArr[h])
    for x in range(0, len(heapArr) - 1, -1):
        A[i] = H.deleteMax()
```

For building a heap with Fix-down, we give an expression for the worst-case of swaps: 

*runtime is:*

$\Theta(S(h)) = S(h) = \Sigma_{i=0}^h(i)(2^{h-i}) <= 2^{h+1}$

(*) $\Sigma_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{i}{2^{i}} = 2$

1. Start from $1
2. Differentiate with x
3. set n =  1/2
4. $N \rightarrow \infty$
